### Downloads

- [Firmware 1.4.1](https://azureboard2.azureedge.net/prod/devkit-firmware-1.4.1.65.bin).




## Version 1.4.0 (July 19, 2018)

### Release Summary

* Firmware
  * Enable firmware update capability in bootloader.
    Now the bootloader can upgrade the firmware from the on-board SPI flash, this is part of the OTA programming (firmware update) feature.
    By integrating with the Azure Automatic Device Configuration service, the OTA firmware update function will be enabled in next release.

* SDK
  * Reduce the size of file system which builds upon the 2MB on-board SPI flash.
    
    **Notice:** Because it need more on-board SPI flash space to store the new firmware for firmware updating, we reduced the space of [file system]({{"docs/apis/file-system" | absolute_url }}). So if you have files on IoT DevKit, please make sure they have been well backed up before upgrade to this new SDK.
    {: .notice--warning}
    
  * Add [setVolume API]({{"docs/apis/audio-v2" | absolute_url }}) to support change the audio volume.

* Mini Solution
  * Update the DevKit Translator to use the new [Audio APIs]({{"docs/apis/audio-v2" | absolute_url }}).

* Development Tools
  * Deprecate existing one-click installation package.
    Our new VS Code extension: [IoT Workbench]( https://aka.ms/iot-workbench) can provide better development experience for IoT DevKit, you can install it from the VS Code marketplace directly and follow this [tutorial]( https://aka.ms/iot-workbench/getstarted) to start using IoT DevKit. 
    
    So starting with 1.4.0 we only provide the Arduino board package (SDK only) and no longer to have the one-click installation package.

## Version 1.3.0 (January 9, 2018)

Happy new year 2018! Let us talk about the fundamentals of IoT this time: the security. IoT DevKit is now amongst the first MCU devices that support [Microsoft IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/about-iot-dps), which is a helper service for IoT Hub that enables zero-touch, just-in-time provisioning to the right IoT hub without requiring human intervention, enabling customers to provision millions of devices in a secure and scalable manner.

### Release Summary

* Firmware
  * Upgrade the IoT DevKit firmware to enable DPS feature.
  * New tool `set_dps_uds` is added in the configuration mode, which help to save the **Unique Device Secret (UDS)** into the STSAFE chip, for more detail please check [this topic]({{"/docs/projects/dps/#save-unique-device-secret-on-stsafe-security-chip" | absolute_url }}).

* SDK
  * Open source [IoT DevKit SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/devkit-sdk), you are welcome to contribute :)
  * Upgrade the Azure IoT C SDK to [1.1.28]( https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/releases/tag/2017-11-17).
  * Archive the Azure IoT C SDK in the Arduino board package, greatly reduce the compile time.
  * Enable the secure channel, protecting confidentiality and integrity of data with STSAFE chip on IoT DevKit.
  * Add reset function `SystemReboot`.

* Mini Solution
  * New mini-solution: [Device registration with Device Provisioning Service]({{"/docs/projects/dps/" | absolute_url }}).

## Version 1.2.1 (November 22, 2017)

The new Audio library gives the ability to continuous recording voice through the microphone.

### Release Summary

* SDK
  * A new version of the Audio driver library (AudioClassV2) has been added. This new version supports call-backs, allowing you to greatly simplify Arduino sketches which need to monitor and react to the current audio state as, for example, when it changes from AUDIO_STATE_RECORDING to AUDIO_STATE_PLAYING.  An example Arduino sketch making use of this new feature may be found in the Audio2 folder under "Examples for MXCHIP AZ3166". Note: The previous AudioClass library has been retained for backward compatibility with legacy sketches. (Sample sketches utilizing the AudioClass.h library may be found in the Audio folder under "Examples for MXCHIP AZ3166".)  Provide V2 version of Audio driver library to support callback in record and play.
  * A name conflict (INADDR_NONE) in source code was generating the error "Expected ')' before numeric constant". This error (documented in Issue 169) has been corrected.

* New Mini Solution
  * A cool mini-solution was added. You can check it out [here](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/projects/air-traffic-control-simulator/).
* Development Tools
  * A Resource Group Location selection option was added when creating  a new resource group in `task cloud provision`.
  * A privacy statement has been added during installation to allow users to choose to enable or disable data collection. 
  * Error handling during development tool installation has been improved.
  * Installation of Visual Studio Code has been updated to better support both X86 and X64 environments.
  * The Azure CLI installation has been updated to version 2.0.20
